## App Summary

Welcome to MySpots!

MySpots is a place where users can store information of a great adventure spot that they discovered. For example if you go hiking and find a spot with waterfall then you can quickly open up the MySpots and it will grab your current location and you can save that spot for future references!  

This gives users a spot to save all their favorite locations in one spot!
